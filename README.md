# Getting Started with Cinema Lookup

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It requires Node.js to be installed on your local machine.
This can be downloaded from [https://nodejs.org/en].

Upon installation wizard and for easier setup, you can select the option to add Node.js to your environment variables. Otherwise you can manually add Node.js to your environment variables under System Variables. Add an entry under PATH to include the path to the nodejs folder. Example: 'C:\Program Files\nodejs\'.

Once this has been installed, it is advised to restart your IDE. You can then run the following scripts:
